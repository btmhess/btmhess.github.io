goal: "Electric conversion of a 1985 Honda Goldwing, with custon drivetrain and tractive battery."

requirements: |
  This vehicle was required to be an effective transportation option for my commute to university. It needed adequate range, reliability, and storage space to be daily transportation.

result: |
  This motorcycle is still my daily transport; I have put around 6000 miles on it commuting to school and back. Once I got all the bugs worked out, it has been very reliable with almost no maintenance.<br>
  So far I have replaced a couple drive belts and refreshed the motor bearings. There has been no meaningful battery degradation.
