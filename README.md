# Project Portfolio

This repository contains the source files for my personal project portfolio,
hosted via GitHub Pages.

The site documents personal engineering and fabrication projects with:
- goals and requirements
- build results and specifications
- materials / parts lists
- image galleries

## Structure

- `_projects/` — individual project files
- `index.html` — main project list / home page
- `_layouts/` — site templates
- `assets/` — Project assets (tables and images), CSS and JavaScript

## Viewing the site

The live site is available at:
